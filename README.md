# RPKI

Resource Public Key Infrastructure ([RPKI]), is a system where
we publish authoritative, signed statements, called Route Origin
Authorizations ([ROA]s), so that other network providers may perform
route origin validation on any annoucements they receive for these
prefixes.

We use the [Hosted RPKI] service provided by our RIR, [ARIN].

## Prepare requirements

### List networks to assign

Verify the `nets.json` file lists the `prefix`, `length`, and
(optionally) `maxlength` for each network you want to include in the
ROA(s).

### Generate ROAs

Run the `genroa.sh` script to create the [RPKI] signing key, generate
[ROA]s and sign them.  By default, the script will use the [our
ASN](https://bgp.he.net/AS22847) and a ROA name of "BOWDOIN", but these
can be modified on the commandline.  The script will first try to
retrieve the organization keypair from 1Password.  If not available, it
will generate a new one and upload to 1Password as a new document in the
Networking vault.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
    $ ./genroa.sh
    Please sign in to 1Password to retrieve private key.
    Enter the password for jlavoie@bowdoin.edu at bowdoin.1password.com:
    Retrieving orgkeypair.pem from 1Password as ARIN RPKI key pair document.
    Extracting public key org_pubkey.cer from keypair orgkeypair.pem
    writing RSA key
    Please add the following to the ARIN hosted RPKI interface for BOWDOI-1

The output will be used in the following steps.

## Set up Hosted RPKI with ARIN

On the [ARIN website](https://account.arin.net/public/secure/org) select
the organization to add the hosted key.  Repeat the following
process for each region and cloud provider.

- Click on "Actions" and "Manage RPKI"

This is one-time process for the organization.  If you
see the RPKI "Status Overview" page, this task has
already been completed.
If so, please skip to [submitting ROAs](#submit-roas-to-arin).

![ARIN Hosted RPKI](images/ARIN-rpki-hosted.png)

- Click on "Configure Hosted"

![ARIN Hosted RPKI Certificate](images/ARIN-rpki-pubkey.png)

- Paste the public key from the `genroa.sh` output.
- Click "Submit". This generates a ticketed request for ARIN
  to generate a resource certificate covering your Internet number
  resources. Youâ€™ll receive a notification in ARIN Online of any
  actions regarding your request.

## Submit ROAs to ARIN

On the [ARIN website](https://account.arin.net/public/secure/org) select
the organization to add the ROAs.

- Click on "Actions" and "Manage RPKI"
- Choose "Create ROA"
- In the "Create a Route Authorization" dialog, choose "Signed"

![ARIN Create ROA](images/ARIN-roa-create.png)

- Paste one of the signed ROAs from the `genroa.sh` output
  (including `-----BEGIN ROA REQUEST-----` through `-----END SIGNATURE-----`)
  into the "Signed ROA Request:" textfield.
- Choose "Next Step"

![ARIN Submit ROA](images/ARIN-roa-submit.png)

- Choose "Submit"
- A "Create ROA" ARIN ticket will be automatically created and processed,
  typically within a couple minutes.

Repeat the process for each signed ROA.
